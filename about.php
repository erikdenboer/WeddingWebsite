            <h3>Recommended means of travel<h3>
            <p>Restaurant De Mof is easy to reach by car, situated 5-10 minutes by car from the highway A12, exit 22 towards Maarsbergen. There is plenty of parking available on the terrain,
                making this one of the easiest ways of reaching the venue. It is also possible to come by train to Amersfoort Central Station and then transferring to bus 80,
                which will drop you right outside the venue in about 20 minutes. However, note that the return bus runs only once an hour on Saturday evenings.
                For additional flexibility, or if you want a real taste of the Dutch way of life, it is possible to rent bikes at the train station, after which it's a 30-minute ride to the venue.
            </p>
